# OxDS Colors

**A uniquely simple color system.**

OxDS colors can be accessed programmatically or through CSS. Developers can dynamically set styles, generate CSS variables, or integrate with CSS-in-JS libraries. It covers # HEX to more perceptual color spaces like Oklch(), including alpha variants. 

Next update will include Dark Mode and custom theming based on the heraldry of the 36 colleges of Oxford. You can find more information on [oxds.uk/foundations/colors](https://oxds.uk/foundations/colors).
